**Question 3. Trip Segmentation Count**

answer = 104,838; 199,013; 109,645; 27,688; 35,202

SELECT COUNT(1) AS trips_up_to_1_mile
FROM green_taxi_trips
where trip_distance <= 1

UNION ALL

SELECT COUNT(1) AS trips_from_1_up_to_3_mile
FROM green_taxi_trips
where trip_distance > 1 and trip_distance <= 3

UNION ALL

SELECT COUNT(1) AS trips_from_3_up_to_7_mile
FROM green_taxi_trips
where trip_distance > 3 and trip_distance <= 7

UNION ALL

SELECT COUNT(1) AS trips_from_7_up_to_10_mile
FROM green_taxi_trips
